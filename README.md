# code-refactor-HW1
This project was oriented around refactoring a web page to improve accessibility, which we hoped would improve the site's search engine optimization. 

## Procedural Steps - What We Did
* Insert semantic HTML elements into the code
* Ensure HTML elements follow a logical structure
* Provide alt attributes for image elements
* Ensure the heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Provided a consise descriptive title for the web page

### Semantic HTML adjustments to original webpage
Changed HTML div to header, main, aside, and footer to give code a more logical flow 

### Ensure HTML Elements follow a logical structure
Indented code base to provide structure and cleaned up some loose closing tags

### Provide alt attributes for image elements

### Ensure heading attributes fall in sequential order
Made all the header tags flow in decending order from h1 to h3 (footer)
